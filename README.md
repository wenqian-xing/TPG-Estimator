# Estimation of treatment effects under nonstationarity via the truncated Policy Gradient Estimator

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks for running the simulations in the paper.

## Data Generation
### Queueing Simulation with Real-world Nonstationary Patient Arrivals.
The simulator in `nonstat_queue.ipynb` is a queueing birth-death chain with inhomogeneous, state-dependent Poisson arrival rates based on a nonstationary estimate of patient arrival rates to an emergency department (both based on day of week, and time of day), obtained using data from the [SEEStat Home Hospital database](https://see-center.iem.technion.ac.il/databases/HomeHospital/). In particular, we calculate the average arrival rates to the emergency department based on records from 2004. 

The notebook `nonstat_queue.ipynb` reads from the file `data0.csv`, which must be generated beforehand. The file should contains four columns (without column names):

| hours | arrival rate | weekday (e.g., Sun, Mon, ...) | weekday index (e.g., Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, ...) |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0.5   | xxx    | Sun                           | 0                                                |
| 1   | xxx    | Sun                           | 0                                                |
| ...   | ...    | ...                           | ...                                                |
| 24   | xxx    | Sun                           | 0                                                |
| ...   | ...    | ...                           | ...                                                |
| 24   | xxx    | Sat                           | 6                                                |

There are two ways to obtain the required patient arrival data:

1. **Download from the database**  
   The data is available at [SEEStat database](https://see-center.iem.technion.ac.il/databases/HomeHospital/), organized as monthly `.mdb` files.

2. **Access via SEEStat on the Technion SEELab server**  
   SEEStat provides tools for data aggregation (e.g., averaging across months). Access to the Technion SEELab server requires an account, which can be requested at [this registration page](https://see-center.iem.technion.ac.il/terminal-see/). Detailed tutorials on using the [SEEStat Online](https://seelab.net.technion.ac.il/seestat/) platform are also available on their website.


### NYC Ride-sharing Simulation.
The notbook `ride_sharing.ipynb` requires simulation data generated from a large-scale NYC ride-sharing simulator. Detailed instructions for running the simulator can be found in `RideSim.md`. To reproduce the plots from the paper, the following simulation outputs are required before running the notebook:

- Simulations under `pure-A` and `pure-B` configurations (used to compute the GATE).
- Simulations under  `switchback` configuration with interval lengths of 600, 1200, 1800, and 3600 seconds.

## Notebooks

### 1. `2_state_MDP.ipynb`
This notebook simulates a nonstationary 2-state Markov Decision Process (MDP). It includes:
- Simulating the state trajectories
- Evaluating the estimation under the TPG estimator

### 2. `nonstat_queue.ipynb`
This notebook simulates a non-stationary queueing system. It includes:
- Reading data from `data0.csv`
- Simulating the queueing dynamics
- Evaluating the estimation under the TPG estimator and other baseline estimators

### 3. `ride_sharing.ipynb`
This notebook analyzes the NYC ride-sharing simulation results. It includes:
- Reading data from `output/pure-A`, `output/pure-B`, `output/switchback`
- Evaluating the estimation under the TPG estimator and other baseline estimators

## Requirements

To install the necessary Python packages for the notebooks, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The additional dependencies needed to run the ride-sharing simulator are listed in `RideSim.md`.


## Acknowledgment

The NYC ride-sharing simulator is adapted from the [dn-ridesharing simulator](https://github.com/atzheng/dn-ridesharing), originally developed by Andrew Zheng (UBC Sauder) and Tianyi Peng (Columbia Business School).
We also gratefully acknowledge the SEE Research Team at the Technionâ€”Israel Institute of Technology for providing the queueing data used in our simulations.
